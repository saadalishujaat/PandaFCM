```


### Step 2

Add maven repository in project level build.gradle.
```
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```  


### Step 3

Add PandaFCM dependencies in App level build.gradle.
```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.saadalishujaat:PandaFCM:1.0'
    
```  


### Step 4
